## Step 4: Adding some logic into the application

Now it's time to add some real content to the website. By now you already have a general understanding of how HTML tags work but if you're confused by anything, please ask.

Let's start by adding the header section with some text to our HTML file. Put this in the `<body>` section of index.erb, deleting what we have there.

```html
<header>
    <h1>Motivational posters</h1>
  </header>
```

Now your webpage should just have one header.

![header](https://github.com/stephenlloyd/Taster/raw/master//day_one/images/motivational_header.png)

Let's add some more content. Let's add the first section on our website. The finished section should look like this.

![kitten_select](https://github.com/stephenlloyd/Taster/raw/master//day_one/images/kitten_select.png)

It will have a header, some text, an input box, a button, an area for search results and Google's branding in the lower right corner (required by the terms and conditions of Google Image Search).

Let's use the `<section>` tag to create section 1. Put this code directly between the closing `</header>` tag and the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
</section>
```

It's very similar to the `<header>` element above it but it has two differences. First is that the we're using the `h2` tag for the actual header, instead of `h1`. This will make it a little bit smaller (`h1` is the biggest, `h6` is the smallest). The second difference is that we are giving this section an id of "select-image". The reason is that we'll have several sections and we'll need to differentiate between them later on. We'll be using the id values to refer to elements from CSS files.

Then let's add some text. Let's use the `<p>` tag to add it.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
</section>
```

Now your web page looks like this.

![select_image](https://github.com/stephenlloyd/Taster/raw/master//day_one/images/select_image.png)

Don't worry that it doesn't look exactly like it'll look at the very end. This is because we haven't added the CSS yet. For now let's make sure we have the elements that we need on the page.

Let's now add the input field for our keyword.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
	<input id="search-term" type="text">
</section>
```

The input field that you can type things in is created by the `<input>` tag. There may be many different types of input tags, the one that looks like a search box is the one that has `type="text"`. We also give it an `id`, so that we could add some CSS later.

Once you have added the input fields, add the button. Not surprisingly, you can use the `<button>` tag to do it. As with other elements, let's give it some `id`.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
</section>
```

These are all elements that we'll need to search for images but we don't have any place to display what we'll find. Let's create an empty element for that.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
</section>
```

The `<div>` element is just a generic element without any special significance. Since it's empty, it won't be visible on the page but it's important it exists because we'll be putting the search results in there. Last, but not least, let's add another empty element for Google branding. This is the requirement of Google Image Search.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <input id="search-term" type="text">
  <button id="go-search">Go!</button>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
  <div id="branding"></div>
</section>
```

So, this is what our application looks like right now.

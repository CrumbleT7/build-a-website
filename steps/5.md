# Making things happen with JavaScript

Our website doesn't do very much yet.  We're going to change that now using JavaScript.  JavaScript is another programming language.  So far, we've used only Ruby to write our application but *Ruby only runs on the server*.  JavaScript, however, is unique because *it can run in the browser*.  That might not mean much to you right now, but it's a game changer!

Let's begin by creating the folder `public/javascript`.  Create two files inside it: `support.js` and `application.js`.

The first file, `support.js` will contain some JavaScript we've written for you for this project (think of it as a library). It is slightly more complicated than the other stuff, so we'll leave it until the end. This file does two things: actually performs a Google Image Search and saves the parameters of the form in the url, so we could tweet it later without losing out motivational image (we'll get to this functionality later).

For now just take the contents of this file from [Github](https://github.com/stephenlloyd/Taster/raw/master//day_one/support.js) and copy-paste it into the `support.js` file in your project - don't worry about using Copy-Paste just this once :). Leave the `application.js` empty for a moment.

Now let's link our JS files to the HTML file using a very similar technique that we used to link CSS files to HTML. Add these four lines into the `<head>` section of your index.erb.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="/javascript/support.js"></script>
<script src="/javascript/application.js"></script>
```

Now your `<head>` section looks like this. The first `<script>` tag links to the google server that will actually perform the image search. The second `<script>` tag links to [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a widely used Javascript library that simplified many operations.

```html
<head>
  <link href="/css/application.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/javascript/support.js"></script>
  <script src="/javascript/application.js"></script>
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
```

However, even though the code is loaded as part of the page, it's inactive right now because we never executed it. Let's see how we can do it.

We want our images to be found when the user clicks the button. The Javascript way of doing it looks like this:

```javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
});
```

So, what's going on here? In plain English, this should be read like this:

> When an element with the id of "go-search" is clicked in the document, a block of code (function) should be executed that will find images on google using the keyword from the field with id of "search-term" and put them in the area with id of "search-results".

Sounds complex, right? It's actually simpler than it seems. Let's break it down into pieces.

To determine what to do when some event happens, we use this Javascript:

```javascript
$(document).on(event, element, function() {
  // what to do when this event happens on this element
});
```

In this case we want to find images when a "click" event happens on the element with id "go-search". Remember we were giving many elements an `id`? That's exactly what they are needed for: to reference the elements later.

If we want to reference an element by `id`, we just put a hash in front of a name. We call this a **CSS selector**.

So, if we want to do something when a button with a specific id is clicked, we write:

```javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  // the action to execute
});
```

Now, what do we want to happen? We want to search Google Images for a given keyword and show the results. Remember we created an input field for the keyword?

```html
<input id="search-term" type="text">
```

It has the `id="search-term"`, so we can reference it using this id to get it's value. To do this, we can use this piece of Javascript.

```javascript
$('#search-term').val()
```

This code means "Take element with id of 'search-term' and give me its value, that is, what's typed inside".

Where do we put the results? Again, remember we created a special area for them?

```html
<div id="search-results"></div>
```

As you can probably guess by now, we can reference this area like this.

```javascript
$("#search-results")
```

Now we have everything we need to tell our browser to get the images from Google and show the results.

```javascript
findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
```

This code asks the browser to go find images on google using whatever is typed into `#search-term` and put the results into `#search-results`. Makes sense?

Now, let's put it all together, so that this code was executed only when the button was pressed.

```javascript
$(document).on('click', '#go-search', function() {
  findImagesOnGoogle({keywords: $('#search-term').val(), container: '#search-results'})
});
```

Now put the code above into application.js and save the file. Refresh your browser, enter the search term and you'll see the results!

Impressive, isn't it? Especially that we did very little work to achieve this result.

It still doesn't look exactly like we want it to look at the very end but we'll fix it soon.

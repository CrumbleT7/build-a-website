## Setting Up Your Dev Environment

* [Prepare to Code](http://www.preparetocode.io/)-
  this guide includes all the steps you might need to set up your Mac to become
a Ruby Dev. Make sure you install the technologies in order, from right to left.
A quick summary of the tech you will be installing:
    *  Xcode Command Line Tools - useful because it installs a
       [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) which
gives access to many UNIX-based applications.
    *  Homebrew - this is what's called a ['package
       manager'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) - basically it
makes it easy for you to install things!
    *  RVM & Ruby - Ruby is already installed on a Mac, but Ruby Version Manager
       (RVM) is a way to conveniently switch between versions of the language to
accomodate different projects. Essential for working on a wide variety of Ruby
projects.
    *  PRY - an alternative to
       [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell) with syntax
highlighting and a plethora of other features which make debugging much more
enjoyable.
    *  Heroku Toolbelt - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a hosting service
       you will be familiar with after completing the MA Taster Weekend.
Installing Heroku's toolbelt will give you command line access to their
fantastic platform!

* [Oh My ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/) - If you fire up your terminal, you'll notice
  that you are using the shell langage
[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) to interact with your
system. While this is all well and good, we find many of our full-time students
switch to ZSH because it offers many exciting features. They tend to do this by
installing Oh My ZSH - quite possibly because it allows you to easily switch
between some very pretty-looking themes...
* [Iterm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - This replacement for Mac's own Terminal
  program is THE way to fly if you're going to be spending time with your
command line. See a video demo
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJEN-GFSkrU).
* [Badassify Your Terminal and
  Shell](http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/) - A fantastic
article to make your experience using the command line infinitely more
pleasurable.

## Command Line

* [Command Line Cheat
  Sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) - Cheat sheets
are indispensible for Developers, and so is learning how to interact with the
Command Line. So this is basically a two-for-one.
* [Unix 101](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/unix_101.html) - Unix is the
  operating system that Mac's OS X is built on. By learning a little Unix, you
can go a long way...

## Ruby

Ruby is the main language at Makers Academy - we love it, and truly believe it
is the most beginner-friendly syntax whilst retaining industry relevance. Here
are some links to get you started:

* [Ruby Kickstart](https://vimeo.com/tag:ruby+kickstart) - Josh Cheek's set of
  video tutorials cut to the meat and get you where you need to be as quickly as
possible. Highly recommended.
* [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) - Zed Shaw is
  opinionated, brash (and hates bootcamps!) But he has written an excellent set
of resources to get you off the ground in a variety of different technologies,
and for that we love him.


## Javascript

JavaScript is the language of the Web, and you're unlikely to be able to avoid
it, or it's insanely powerful properties. So to meet it head on:

* [JavaScript The Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/)
* [Superhero JS](http://superherojs.com/)
* [Must See JavaScript Dev Tools That Put Other Dev Tools to
  Shame](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/must-see-javascript-dev-tools-that-put-other-dev-tools-to-shame-aca6d3e3d925#.y5bittfal)

## Books

### Ruby

* [The Well Grounded
  Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-second-edition)
- a very comprehensive introduction to the language and beginner-friendly (just
  ignore the first chapter about libraries as it's rather dense.)

### JavaScript

* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://jstherightway.org/) 0 available in print, or
  online for free
* [JavaScript & jQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) - a fantastic book and
  particularly accessible to beginners.

### HTML & CSS

* [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - by the creator of the
  [JavaScript & jQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book. An excellent
introduction to coding for any beginner.
* [Handcrafted CSS](http://handcraftedcss.com/) - if you are wanting to write
  CSS that will last, this is the resource for you.
